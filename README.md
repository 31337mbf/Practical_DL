Fork of Lempitsky DL for HSE master students
Lecture and seminar materials for each week is in ./week* folders

# Coordinates
* The classes are currently happening on __fridays at 18.00, room 400 (CS.HSE)__. There is also a backup thread for those who __cannot__ appear in the main thread(please e-mail or PM@slack us for details).
